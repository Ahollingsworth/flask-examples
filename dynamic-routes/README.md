## Dynamic Routes

Something is different about the app.py file now. What is different?

Try visiting the "/" page. Now try visiting "/monkey". What do you see?
Why do you think that is the case?

### Experiments

  * Make it so that if the person visits /secret, they see a special
    page that's different than any other
  * Make it so that if the user visits /cows/3 they see a page that says
    "There are 3 cows"
