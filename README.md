## Teacher guides

Each directory in this git repository has its own README file with additional info on the
particular example. In addition, every example directory has an additional python
app that ends in "-teacher". This file contains many comments describing the functionality of
the python application. In most cases there are additional template files added that are specific
to the "teacher edition" of the application. Note that the teacher files are not installed by
the installation scripts given above. You will need to download the repository on your own and
add the files to your nitrous box by hand.
