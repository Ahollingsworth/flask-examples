## Logic App

This is similar to the other logic apps ("logic" and "logic-template"),
but it only uses conditionals in the app code itself. The two potential
templates it displays ("dogs.html" or "cats.html") are both static; they
have no dependence on any variables defined in the app.

### Teacher guide

  * Here we introduce the use of conditional logic (if, else)
    in the template. See the "logic" and "logic-template" apps for more.
