## Logic Template

The app sets a couple of true-or-false variables and the index.html
template uses those to determine what is shown. By only changing the
app's variables, how can you correct the math equation that is
displayed?

### Teacher guide

  * Another usage of conditional logic (if, else)
    in the template. See notes for the "logic" app for more.
