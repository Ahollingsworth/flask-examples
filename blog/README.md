## Micro Blog

This is a full-featured app that lets you and your friends create a
blog.

How does the blog store its posts? What happens if you stop the python
server and start it again? Where did the posts go? Why do they not
stay?

This index.html template has something we haven't seen before:
`{% for %}`. What does that do?

## Experiments

  * How would you add the date along with each post automatically?
