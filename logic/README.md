## Logic

This index.html template has some new stuff that wasn't in our other
templates. What's different?

## Experiments

 * What can you change to make the web page show something different
   without changing the template itself?

### Teacher guide

  * Here we introduce the use of conditional logic (if, else)
    in the template. See the notes in the python file for more.
