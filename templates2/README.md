## Templates v2.0

What is different about the index page now?

How does it show the name Robot? You don't see the word Robot in the
index.html, do you? Why not? How did the word get there?

### Experiments

  * Change the index page so that is shows Your name
  * Change the index page so that it says your name and your age.
    But do it without putting your age directly in the index.html.
  * What happens if you put a variable in your template that you do
    not mention in your 'render_template' method call?
