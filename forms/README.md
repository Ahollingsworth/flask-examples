## Forms

We are importing something else at the top of the app.py file now. What
is it?

Where do you see the 'request' object that we imported used?

### Experiments

  * What happens after you fill in the form and click 'submit'. What
    does the URL look like?
  * Change the index.html file so that the form's method is "post"
    instead of "get". Now try reloading the index page and submitting
    the form. How does the url change? How is this different than when
    the form's method was 'get'?
  * Draw a diagram that shows the flow of information from one page to
    the next. Show each template file, and what is rendered on that
    page, and how the server responds to it.
  * Add another input field to your form for "favorite color". Make it
    so that the result page shows the favorite color that you filled in.
